# NeuralNetwork

NeuralNetwork has gained the attention of the world community immensely in the last one decade although the theoretical foundation of the concept was given in the early 1940s.However, due to computational power constraints it was long considered to be useless.Jeff Hinton and his associates at the University of Toronto improvised the idea and made it possible to work effectively.


# Definition :

NeuralNetwork is a mathematical model which tries to follow the working of human brain and generate intelligence out of the given data .

# Mathematical Definition :
NeuralNetwork is a mathematical nonlinear function approximator.

                X is a set of inputs.(Matrix of 1*3)
                W is a Weights.      (Matrix of 3*1)
                Y is a Output        (Matrix of 1*1)
 Mathematically , the image can be written as :
 
            # X.W = Y

## Application : It's application is very wide and solve the complex problems.
              Following are some of the scalable applications where it is very extensively used :
                        1. Google Speech To Text
                        2. ALEXA by Amazon
                        3. Image Recognition
                        4. Self Driving Cars
                        5. Chatting Bots
                        
# Following are the mathematical concepts which one should have an overview of prior to proceeding ahead with Neural Network :
                        1. Linear ALgebra 
                                a. Matrix Multiplication
                                b. Matrix Addition
                                c. Matrix transpose
                                d. Matrix properties 
                        2. Calculus
                                a. Chain Rule of Differentiation
                                
# Popular Frameworks & Libraries :
For the development of Neural Network application, number of software corporations around the world has offered their libraries in languages like PYTHON , C++ , R , JAVA. However , python language remains the most popular within AI community due to its simplicity and ease of use .Some of the most popular DEEP NEURAL NETWORK frameworks are :
                         1. Tensorflow by GOOGLE
                         2. Theano by BSD
                         3. PYTorch by Facebook
                         4. MXNET by AMAZON
                         5. Numpy by BSD
                         
Over the course of time I would dealing in detail of how the Neural Network works using Numpy .
