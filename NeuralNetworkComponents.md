### Artificial Network can be broadly classified into following fundamental building blocks :
              1. Inputs
              2. Bias
              3. Neurons
              4. Layers
              5. Activation function
              6. Loss Function
              7. Expected Output

### The entire data processing in Neural Network can be classified into two steps :
             1.  Forward Propogation
             2.  Backpropogation
