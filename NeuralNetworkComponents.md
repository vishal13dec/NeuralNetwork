### Artificial Network can be broadly classified into following fundamental building blocks :
              1. Inputs
              2. Bias
              3. Neurons
              4. Layers
              5. Activation function
              6. Loss Function
              7. Expected Output

### The entire data processing in Neural Network can be classified into two steps :
             1.  Forward Propogation
             2.  Backpropogation

### Forward Propgation :
Forward Propgation can be defined as the process of deriving the output value using the WEIGHTS , BIAS , Activation funcation on given input values.


### Backpropgation :
Backpropgation is the process of deriving the updated weights and biases based on the loss function i.e difference between expected and derived output.


### Activation Function :
The non-linearity in neural network is introduced using the Activation function.

Linear function are function which are unidirectional with uniform slope. They do have highest 1 degree polynomial.
Non-Linear function are function which are having varying slope i.e their direction varies with the value of input after sometime .
